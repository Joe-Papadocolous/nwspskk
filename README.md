Outputs names and passwords of all previously used networks to a text file.  

This is a project I created for fun. Mostly created in high school, minor imrovements since. -MJL

Version 1.1:
 - Fixes bug that occurs when a network name contains a space
 - Fixes bug that occurs caused by public networks

Version 1.2:
 - Doesn't crash if apostrophe is in network name

Known problems:
 - Does not dislay password for the following:
    - networks that use SSO
    - network with an apostrophe in the name (common with iPhone hotspots)

Future improvements:
 - Add date/time to created file
